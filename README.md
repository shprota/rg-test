# Resource Guru engineering code challenge

I had less than an hour to take this exercise, so I could definitely get something wrong.

1. I created two versions for array flattening. One using the JS stack (recursive) and another using the available RAM. 20 min spent.
1. Did my best to refactor the code for the math tree and added some basic validation. I wasn't sure what exactly was expected from this exercise, so I favored the code brevity and leggibility. 30 min spent mostly due to the uncertainity of the expected result.

### Running the code
`node flatten.js`

`node tree.js`

No external dependencies. Requires a recent nodejs runtime version.
